# overview 
Your task in this assignment is to aggregate the data found in the Citi Bike Trip History Logs and find two unexpected phenomena. <br />  
Design 2â€“5 visualizations for each discovered phenomenon. You may work with a timespan of your choosing. Optionally, you can also merge multiple datasets from different periods.

## Tasks
The following are questions you may wish to answer:  

How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period? <br /> 
**103,299 in June 2022 and 97,023 in June of 2023**

By what percentage has total ridership grown/decreased? <br />
**Ridership decreased by roughly 6% compared to June of the previous year.**

How have the proportions of short-term customers and annual subscribers changed? <br />
**While overall rides are down compared to the previous June, membership riders account for 71% of all June 2023 rides compared to 61% the previous June.**

What are the peak hours when bikes are used during the summer months?<br />
**I found the peak hours for the Month of June to be 1800, 1700, and 1900 (6 PM, 5PM, and 7PM) respectively.**

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for starting a journey? Based on data, why do you hypothesize these are the top locations?<br />
**The top 10 are: Grove St Path, Hoboken Terminal -River ST & Hudson PL, South Waterfront Walkway - Sinatra Drive & 1st ST, Hoboken Terminal -Hudson ST & Hudson PL, Newport Path, City Hall- Washington ST, Hamilton Park, Newport PKWY, 12 ST & Sinatra DR N, 14 ST Ferry - 14 ST & Shipyard LN. Based on the map I created I beleive this is due to the location's close proxemity to the scenic waterways.**

Today, what are the top 10 stations in the city for ending a journey? Based on data, why? <br />
**The top 10 are: Grove St Path,Hoboken Terminal -River ST & Hudson PL, South Waterfront Walkway - Sinatra Drive & 1st ST, Hoboken Terminal -Hudson ST & Hudson PL, Newport Path, City Hall- Washington ST, Hamilton Park, 12 ST & Sinatra DR N, Newport PKWY, 14 ST Ferry - 14 ST & Shipyard LN. As you can see they are very similar to the top 10 starting points. That is because a majority of riders returned their bikes to the same stations when they were finished. I believe this is due to the close porximity of the their parked cars.**

What was the busiest day for citibike in the time period you reviewed? <br />
**The busiest day for citibike was June 4th, 2022. There were 4,245 rides taken on that day**

## Dashboards and Stories
Use your visualizations (not necessarily all of them) to design a dashboard for each phenomenon. The dashboards should be accompanied by an analysis explaining why each phenomenon may be occurring.

Create the following visualization for city officials:

A static map that plots all bike stations with a visual indication of the most popular locations to start and end a journey, with zip code data overlaid on top.

The map you choose should also be accompanied by a write-up describing any trends that were noticed during your analysis.

Create your final presentation:

Create a Tableau story that brings together the visualizations, requested maps, and dashboards.

Ensure your presentation is professional, logical, and visually appealing.

## Additional notes:
I added interactive compatibility to my dashboards/story that update graphs and charts based on the selection clicked on. Example: if you click on a station name in the chart it will highlight that station on the map.
